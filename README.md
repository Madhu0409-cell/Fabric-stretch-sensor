# Fabric-stretch-sensor
The primary focus of the project is to build fabric stretch sensors.In the last decade there has been an increasing interest for developing different types of wearable sensors. There are many sensor types that have shown potential as wearable sensors among them piezoresistive films which show good change in resistance by simple changes to their geometry and observed micro cracking contributing to high gauge factors .Although their durability and strechability are areas of concern for further development. Capacitive sensors are another common type seeing in touch screens because of their good sensitivity, low energy and adaptability . They have however mainly being used for pressure because they suffer from environmental noise and hence becomes very difficult for use in wearable applications. Textile-based sensors are desirable for wearable end users because they are comfortable, flexible, and not obstructive to the wearerâ€™s everyday activities. A textile sensor can be designed and presented in numerous types and forms.So the main goal of y project is to build fabric stretch sensors with aue considerations.
