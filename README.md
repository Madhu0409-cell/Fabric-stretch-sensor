# Fabric-stretch-sensor
The primary focus of the project is to build fabric stretch sensors.In the last decade there has been an increasing interest for developing different types of wearable sensors. There are many sensor types that have shown potential as wearable sensors among them piezoresistive films which show good change in resistance by simple changes to their geometry and observed micro cracking contributing to high gauge factors .Although their durability and strechability are areas of concern for further development. Capacitive sensors are another common type seeing in touch screens because of their good sensitivity, low energy and adaptability . They have however mainly being used for pressure because they suffer from environmental noise and hence becomes very difficult for use in wearable applications. Textile-based sensors are desirable for wearable end users because they are comfortable, flexible, and not obstructive to the wearer’s everyday activities. A textile sensor can be designed and presented in numerous types and forms.So the main goal of y project is to build fabric stretch sensors with aue considerations.
# Background

## Real-time Application area and functionality:
This project idea could play a significant role in medical field. It could be great help to the physically and mentally challenged persons who are not able to communicate their needs and uneasiness in their body to the world around them for offering immediate help and support. The main goal of the project is inspired by the existing scientific literature [1]As it is a wearable technology, it’s always attached to user and through touch interface regularly tracks the heart rate, blood pressure and monitors breathing pattern of the user .They are used not only in the medical field but also various other areas.In the medical field, they are used in monitoring systems for early detection of dangerous situations and diseases by monitoring the patient’s health status and in medical automation systems that provide continuous treatment or rehabilitation services. [5]Methods that use biological signals for automatic measurement of stress and objective data collection have achieved practical results in many scenarios. [4] Biological-signal interfaces are used in rehabilitation, fitness, and sports training such as practicing the method of controlling breathing or training body balancing.The application of biological-signal systems has expanded beyond the medical services to various other areas such as education, information security, and human-computer interaction as the Internet and mobile devices have become ubiquitous[14]. Measurement of the physiological or physical performance data not only improves our understanding of the physical health but also help us better understand the experience of users by supplementing the results of other methods.

## Overview of Project idea
The main working principle of my chosen area of wearable e-textiles would be to sense and detect the bio signals such as breathing rate from user's body through textile sensors and tracking the response of users and signalling the output through the means of LED displays which brightens up based on the resistance range of sensors and the corresponding change in resistance to change in voltage could be done by means of voltage divider.This principle of chosen project idea is similar to the working idea of the paper[12].

## Outcome of the project:
This project could successfully track biological signals such as  measurement of breathing rate and send responses by means of output LED's.This project idea plays a immense role in medical field.By this means,the collection of performance data not only improves our understanding of the physical health but also help us better understand the experience of users by supplementing the results of other methods.

## Existing Commercial Products:
       XSENSOR Technology cooperation’s Textile sensor for tracking bio signals
       Google and Levi’s Jacquard Conductive Fabric jacket using textile switches
       
# Project concept
The main concept of my project revolves around building stretchable sensors that could be attached in a belt to capture the breathing rate of the user.The wearable E-textile breathing belt use fabric stretch sensors to turn analog motion to digital data. The capturing of this data can be used to visualize and record human body movement. Sewing stretch sensors into form-fitting clothing allows us to establish a mutual relationship between the movement of the ribs and the movement of a sensor placed on that joint.Fabric sensor would be built in such a way that they have a maximum extension of 80mm (80% strain of their active area). Once they have extended to this length, they strainlock (i.e. cannot be stretched any further). This ensures they are always operating within their strain limits and prevents them from being damaged by overstretching.Stretch sensor is made from a conductive fabric designed to have  sensitivity  allowing for incredibly precise measurements.The fabric sensors  are designed to measure how much they have stretched (i.e. the shape change), by brightening up the LED's in a means to provide visual feedback.The Fabric Stretch Sensors are supposed to generate the best results when attached to close-fitting garments that allow the sensors to follow body motion precisely. Correct mounting of the sensors is very important as sensors attached to loose or ill-fitting clothing will generate inaccurate results.

## User Interaction:
The below statements states the detailed steps on how user would interact with the Fabric Stretch Sensors stitched with the belt.
Typically user could observe the fabric stretch sensor stitched on cotton strap with buckle and placed on the 15 x 15 frame.
User could take the belt and could wear the fabric stretch sensor made as a form of belt around his waist.
First he could remain in relaxed position and observe the led attached for visual feedback turned off
Then he can take a deep breath that would stretch the sensor 
Now he can again visualize the LED attached that would blink brightly depicting change in breath pattern

# Project Implementation
# List of Materials:
## EeonTex Conductive fabric
Conductive fabric is needed in this project as it offers the softness and malleability of fabric, while also having electrical properties.
It's of main use in this projects as a soft, flexible and washable circuit is needed
## Conductive thread
Conductive thread is a main requirement as it can carry current the same way that wires can and used to create a circuit.
This allows the user to sew a circuit together, creating flexible circuits that require no soldering.
In my textile-based projects, this is the most practical tool to maintain the hang of the fabric.
## Sewable Cell Coin Battery Holder[ With power supply]
Battery is needed for powering the electrical instruments and a sewable cell coin battery holder makes electrical contact with the battery terminals
This helps to retain and protect the batteries and prevent damage to circuitry and components from battery leakage.
## Conductive tape
Conductive tape is needed to acts like a wire that carries electricity between a battery and components like LEDs, buzzers,etc.
## Multimeter
Multimeter is needed in this project to measure several functions such as voltage, current, and resistance.
It could be used to provide visual feedback with a moving pointer to display readings.
## Buzzer
An audio signalling device is needed in this project to provide auditory feedback on abnormal breathing pattern which could reach others in terms of emergency.
## Light emitting diode(LED)
Brightening of LED on reaching particular value of sensor unit helps to provide a proper visual feedback
## Potentiometer
This project essentially needs a voltage divider circuit for measuring electric potential that changes a large voltage into a small voltage based on set value and potentiometer could be used in it.
## Bart and Francis E-Textile Metal Soft Knit
As the main goal of the project revolves around building Fabric stretch sensor, this could play a great role for making knitted stretch sensors
## Iron-on Adhesive (double-sided)
As the Fabric stretch sensor is planned to be attached to a belt that could be tied around waist, Iron-on adhesive is needed for easy and quick connection and for fixing on a surface of a belt particularly made of leather.
## 3D printed knitting spool machine
knitting spool machine with needles could be immense help to knit a stretch sensor with the conductive yarns.As the circular knit but is very messy at the edges when it comes to trying to knit a flat piece. The machine could be used to knit a tube and include patches of conductive thread to create the knit
